        "The pharmacy application enables digital prescription management by allowing customers to upload prescriptions, which pharmacists can verify and process.

The system ensures compliance with drug regulations, prevents dispensing errors, and maintains records for future reference. Additionally, it can integrate with doctorsâ€™ systems for e-prescription processing.",

It helps prevent overstocking and stockouts by predicting demand based on past sales data. Additionally, it manages supplier orders, tracks batch numbers, and ensures medicines are stored within their recommended shelf life.",
